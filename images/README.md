Chess piece assets
==================

We use on-disk SVG pieces loaded by the popup. The current files are classic Staunton-style placeholders. If you prefer the widely used open-source Cburnett set (very similar to chess.com’s look), download them and place them here with these filenames:

- w_king.svg, w_queen.svg, w_rook.svg, w_bishop.svg, w_knight.svg, w_pawn.svg
- b_king.svg, b_queen.svg, b_rook.svg, b_bishop.svg, b_knight.svg, b_pawn.svg

Recommended source (Wikimedia, Cburnett, 45px variant):
- White: Chess_klt45.svg (king), Chess_qlt45.svg (queen), Chess_rlt45.svg (rook), Chess_blt45.svg (bishop), Chess_nlt45.svg (knight), Chess_plt45.svg (pawn)
- Black: Chess_kdt45.svg (king), Chess_qdt45.svg (queen), Chess_rdt45.svg (rook), Chess_bdt45.svg (bishop), Chess_ndt45.svg (knight), Chess_pdt45.svg (pawn)

Rename the downloaded files to match our naming above (e.g., Chess_klt45.svg → w_king.svg).
